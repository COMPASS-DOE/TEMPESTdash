**Purpose:** The TEMPEST Project uses a spatially distributed array of TEROS 12 sensors to continuously monitor soil temperature, water content, and electrical conductivity within each experimental plot. This folder contains the following relevant resources:

  - TEMPEST_TEROS 12 exp design and installation protocol
  - Data - **under construction**
  - TEMPEST_TEROS 12 location and ID
  - TEROS 12 Manual
  - Photos
  
**Overview:** Each TEMPEST treatment plot has been divided into 80, 25-m2 grid cells. By using this grid-style layout and a centrally-focused experimental design, we aim to maximize plot-level data collection on soil temperature, water content, and electrical conductivity. Meter TEROS 12 sensors are installed in 36 central grid cells per plot: 31 locations have a single sensor at 15 cm below the soil surface and 5 locations have three sensors at 5, 15, and 30 cm below the soil surface. This network distribution results in 45% grid cell coverage across the entire plot and 75% grid cell coverage within the plot buffer boundary (Control Plot Network Distribution example below).
