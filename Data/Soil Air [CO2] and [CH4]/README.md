**Purpose:** The TEMPEST Project uses soil gas well nests to measure carbon dioxide and methane concentrations in soil air at 5-10, 15-20, 30-35, and 45-50 cm below the soil surface. This folder contains the following relevant resources:

  - TEMPEST_Gas Well exp design and installation protocol
  - Data - **under construction**
  - TEMPEST_Gas well location and ID
  - Photos
  
**Overview:** Five gas well nests have been installed within each TEMPEST treatment plot to quantify depth-specific soil air [CO2] and [CH4]. Target depths = 5-10, 15-20, 30-35, and 45-50 cm below the soil surface. Gas well nests are co-located with continuous measurements of soil temperature, water content, and electrical conductivity (TEROS 12 sensors, installed at 5, 15, and 30 cm below the soil surface) and periodic measurements of soil porewater chemisty (lysimeters installed at 15 cm below the soil surface). The nest design is shown below:

**TEMPEST_Gas Well exp design and installation protocol:** This document provides a detailed description and schematics of the TEMPEST gas well nest locations, installation, and data collection procedure. 

**Data:** Under Construction.

**TEMPEST_Gas well location and ID**: This spreadsheet details the following information for each gas well nest:
  - Plot: Freshwater, Seawater, or Control
  - Grid Square
  - ID
  - Address
  - ID
  - Depth: cm below the soil surface
  
  **Photos:** Gas well installation and data collection.
