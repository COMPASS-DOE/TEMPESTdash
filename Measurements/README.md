## Ongoing Measurement Summary & New Measurement Proposals/Requests

**Purpose:** The "Measurements" folder provides an updated summary of ongoing TEMPEST measurements and streamlines proposals/requests for new analyses. This folder contains the following resources (described below):
  - TEMPEST_Ongoing Measurement Summary
  - TEMPEST_Concluded Measurement Summary
  - TEMPEST_New Measurement and Infrastructure Requests

**Ongoing Measurement Summary - Description:** This file provides an overview of the ecological variables currently measured at the TEMPEST site. Measurements are organized by ecosystem component (e.g. Application Water, Plant, Soil, Water). Variable-specific data stewards and availabilities are also indicated here. We encourage you to reach out to these personnel with measurement questions or to initiate collaborative projects. Column descriptions are below:

  - Ecosystem Component: Application water, plant, soil, soil-plant, or water
  - Variable: Measurement description
  - Measurement Type: Periodic or continuous
  - Measurement Frequency: Data collection interval; contact data steward for clarification on "Irregular" frequencies
  - Measurement Location: Indicates sampling height, depth, etc.
  - Replicates: Experimental replicates
  - Measurement Start Date: Month and Year
  - Data Storage: Data location
  - Indicator Of: Ecological significance of variable
  - Research Group: Designated by principal investigator last name
  - Data Steward: Name of data manager
  - Data Steward Email: Email for primary data contact
  - Notes: Contact data steward for clarification on brief notes
  
  **Concluded Measurement Summary - Description:** This file details measurements previously made at the TEMPEST site. Please contact the data steward for methodological questions and data availability. The file organization and column descriptions are the same as above.
  
  **New Measurement and Infrastructure Requests - Description:** This file outlines infrastructure and scientific equipment requests for the TEMPEST Project. Infrastructure and scientific requests are listed on separate tabs and organized by priority level. Requests will be approved based on need and funding availability. Column descriptions are below:
    
  - Component Category: Project or ecosystem category
  - Item: Product 
  - Part Number: Item ID
  - Description: Details item use
  - Link: Link to product website
  - Vendor
  - Quote Number: if available
  - Contact Name: Company representative
  - Contact Number: Company rep contact information
  - Unit Price
  - Quantity
  - Total: Total cost
  - Priority Level: 1 = Item is critical to the success of TEMPEST; 2 = Item would signigicantly improve science and/or infrastrucutre; 3 = Item would be improve science         and/or infrastructure
  - Status: Acknowledged = request has been documented and assigned priority level; Allocated = funds have been set aside for this item; Ordered = purchase order has been submitted; Received = intact item has been received
